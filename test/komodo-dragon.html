          The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), also known as the Komodo
          monitor, is a member of the monitor lizard family Varanidae that is
          endemic to the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, and Gili
          Motang. It is the largest extant species of lizard, growing to a
          maximum length of 3 metres (10 ft), and weighing up to approximately
          70 kilograms (150 lb).</br>
          As a result of their size, Komodo dragons are apex predators, and dominate the ecosystems in which they live. Komodo dragons hunt and ambush prey including invertebrates, birds, and mammals. It has been claimed that they have a venomous bite; there are two glands in the lower jaw that secrete several toxic proteins. The biological significance of these proteins is disputed, but the glands have been shown to secrete an anticoagulant. Komodo dragons' group behavior in hunting is exceptional in the reptile world.
