          The red panda (Ailurus fulgens), also known as the lesser panda, is a
          small mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China.
          It has dense reddish-brown fur with a black belly and legs,
          white-lined ears, a mostly white muzzle and a ringed tail. Its
          head-to-body length is 51–63.5 cm (20.1–25.0 in) with a 28–48.5 cm
          (11.0–19.1 in) tail, and it weighs between 3.2 and 15 kg (7.1 and 33.1
          lb). It is well adapted to climbing due to its flexible joints and
          curved semi-retractile claws.
          <br />
          The red panda was first formally described in 1825. The two currently
          recognised subspecies, the Himalayan and the Chinese red panda,
          genetically diverged about 250,000 years ago. The red panda's place on
          the evolutionary tree has been debated, but modern genetic evidence
          places it in close affinity with raccoons, weasels and skunks. It is
          not closely related to the giant panda, which is a bear, though both
          possess elongated wrist bones or "false thumbs" used for grasping
          bamboo.
