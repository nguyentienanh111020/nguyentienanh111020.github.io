          The giant panda ,also known as the panda bear (or simply the panda),
          is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its bold
          black-and-white coat and rotund body. Though it belongs to the order
          Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and
          leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in the wild
          will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the
          form of birds, rodents, or carrion.
          <br />
          The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China,
          mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu. As a
          result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant
          panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived,
          and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species.
