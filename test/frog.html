          A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of
          short-bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order Anura (ανοὐρά,
          literally without tail in Ancient Greek). The oldest fossil
          "proto-frog" Triadobatrachus is known from the Early Triassic of
          Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests their split from other
          amphibians may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years
          ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to
          subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity
          is in tropical rainforest. Frogs account for around 88% of extant
          amphibian species. They are also one of the five most diverse
          vertebrate orders.
