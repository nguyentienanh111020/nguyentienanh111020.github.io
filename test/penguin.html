          Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds. They live almost
          exclusively in the southern hemisphere: only one species, the
          Galápagos penguin, is found north of the Equator. Highly adapted for
          life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage
          and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid
          and other forms of sea life which they catch while swimming
          underwater. They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the
          other half in the sea.
          <br />
          Although almost all penguin species are native to the southern
          hemisphere, they are not found only in areas with cold climates, such
          as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live that far
          south. Several species are found in the temperate zone, and one
          species, the Galápagos penguin, lives near the Equator.
