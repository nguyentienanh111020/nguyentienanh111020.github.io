          The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat native to Africa and
          central Iran. It is the fastest land animal, estimated to be capable
          of running at 80 to 128 km/h (50 to 80 mph) with the fastest reliably
          recorded speeds being 93 and 98 km/h (58 and 61 mph), and as such has
          several adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs
          and a long tail. It typically reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the
          shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft
          7 in and 4 ft 11 in).
          <br />
          Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). Its head is small
          and rounded, and has a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks.
          The coat is typically tawny to creamy white or pale buff and is mostly
          covered with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Four subspecies are
          recognised.
